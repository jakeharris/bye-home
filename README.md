"I'm always willing to help a friend in need!"

Bye, Home is the story of a young girl named Maya and her adventures across the globe. You play as Maya, and 
help baby animals find their way home by leading them to the biomes they live in. But you don't always know where 
they live, and they don't call home "tundra" -- so you'll have to listen to their hints and figure it out yourself!
